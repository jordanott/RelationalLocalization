# Relational Localization


### To Do
- [x] SSD for real time detection, streamed from camera  
- [x] Modify RN for localization
- [ ] Create dataset from real images
  - [ ] Relational questions
  - [ ] Non-relational questions
  - [ ] Bounding box coordinates (x,y,w,h)
- [ ] Experiments
  - [ ] CNN without RN
    - [ ] Non-relational questions
    - [ ] Non-relational & relational questions
  - [ ] CNN with RN
    - [ ] Non-relational questions
    - [ ] Non-relational & relational questions
  - [ ] Question embedding options
    - [ ] Preset one-hot questions (no RNN)
    - [ ] With RNN to process questions
- [ ] Visualize bounding box results on images
